# reactToDoWithLS

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React, stored in the `client` folder of this repository. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Type a task in the input field and click "Add" or press Enter to add it to the list.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Mark as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox, which applies a strikethrough to the task text.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in local storage to keep them across sessions.

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:
