# reactToDoWithLS
1 Basic Setup a. Set up a simple React project (no need for complex folder structures). b. Use functional components and React hooks. 2 Core Features a. Add a To-Do Item: Allow the user to add a new item to the to-do list through a simple input field and submit button. b. View List: Display the list of to-do items. Each item should show the text and a "Delete" button. c. Delete Item: Allow the user to delete an item from the list. 3 UI/UX a. Basic styling to make the list and input field clear and organized. b. Show a message when there are no items in the list (e.g., "No tasks to display"). 4 Bonus (Optional, if time allows) a. Add a checkbox for each item to mark it as complete. b. Use local storage to persist the to-do list between page reloads.
